# AOA Complaints Docs

## Getting Complaints from Members

* Use your discretion when saying that you will be willing to reach out to the vendor that they are complaining against
    * If they are a current advertiser, we have a little bit of leverage because we have the power to pull them after **3 unresolved complaints**
* At the very least, make sure to ***log the complaint on GM*** and update the note if anything changes
