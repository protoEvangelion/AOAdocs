## Getting Call-in Referrals

* When you get a call-in for a given type of company (*say a plumber*), look up that company in the magazine area where their property is located
* The companies that you gave referrals for, make sure to ***mark them in Gold Mine*** that you referred a member to them
    * The more info you put in GM the better
