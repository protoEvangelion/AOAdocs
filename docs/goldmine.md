# Goldmine Docs

> This documentation describes the features and common operations done in the Goldmine (GM) Customer Relationship Management database.

## Searching the database

* The fastest way to search GM is by **double clicking** on the field that you would like to search for
  * For the `email` and `website` fields, you have to right click it and select `lookup`
  * You can also search using the dropdown

* Pay attention to the **operator** you use when searching
  * `contains` will search for contacts that contain the input (*I usually use this*)
  * `begins with` will only search for contacts that begin with the input
  * The rest are pretty self-explanatory <br/><br/>

## New Contacts: Creating/Deleting

* Creating new contacts is a very common operation in GM
    * Be careful not to create **duplicate contacts**
        * * GM will alert* you if you are about to create a duplicate contact if it has the same email or name that you just entered
    * If there is already a contact in GM, just ***update*** it <br/><br/>

* Although it is tedious, ***you have to enter the first name twice***
    * Once in the `Contact` field and once in the `First Name` field
    * This allows you to **search** for the full name and also use the powerful **email templating** feature of GM <br/><br/>

* To delete just click the red "X" <br/><br/>

## Filters: Creating a Filter

This is great for creating **email lists or call lists** alike

## Notes: Creating/Modifying/Deleting

* Notes are the ***cornerstone*** of GM
    * We use them to determine:
      * If they have been **sold to before** by another rep
      * If they have a **good track record** when referring them to our members
      * To track **when we refer** them to our members
      * To view your **history** or another reps history with them
      * To determine whether or not the company has been **contacted in the last 3 months** (*companies who have not been sold before and have not been contacted in the last 3 months are open to sell*) <br/><br/>

## Calendar: Completing or Deleting Calls/Appointments

The following shows how to complete or delete calls once you complete them or they are cancelled

## Email Templates: Sending an email

* Email templates are an ***incredibly powerful feature*** of GM
    * It speeds up your emailing process significantly <br/><br/>

* Email templates integrate with Microsoft Outlook <br/><br/>

## Email Templates: Modifying an existing template

* Modify existing templates by using the documents tab
  * ***be VERY CAREFUL not to double click on an email template because that will prepare to send the email to multiple contacts***
  * You want to ***right click*** on a template to modify it
  * Also be cautious when modifying if it is a **public** template because your changes will show up on other people's templates (*Richard & Todd*) <br/><br/>

## Email Templates: Creating a new template

* If you would like to create an additional template, I would suggest **duplicating** an existing template and then modifying it
  * It is pretty confusing to set up a new template from scratch <br/><br/>

* You can also change whether or not the template is public or private
  * **Create templates just for yourself** by clicking the `user` dropdown and selecting your username like I do in the video below <br/><br/>

## Email Templates: Tradeshow Fields

* We created ***trade show fields*** specifically to be used for **booth confirmations** and trade show **reminders**
    * Adding info to these fields really **speeds the email process up** because you will be sending 100s of emails for each show every year <br/><br/>
