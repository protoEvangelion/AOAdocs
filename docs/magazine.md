# AOA Magazine Docs

## Call sheets

* Make sure to record your calls on the physical call sheet or on the excel call sheet and ***place in Dan's box*** at end of each day

## Deadlines

* To keep things simple for yourself here is how to communicate deadlines to clients:
    * **Ad needs changes or needs to be created**: 1st of the preceding month
          * e.g. ***January 1st*** for the February publication <br/><br/>
    * **Ad is ready to go**: 7th of the preceding month
        * e.g. ***January 7th*** for the February publication <br/><br/>

* You have until around **10am** the following day to finish your masters changes

## Late Changes

* If a current client or a prospective client wants to make changes **after the 1st** AND you have not put them on masters, you have to: <br/><br/>
    1. Get Dan's ***signature***
    2. Make copies for Jamil and Shelly

## Using Masters

* ***Masters 1*** corresponds to the 1st deadline mentioned above <br/><br/>
* ***Masters 2*** corresponds to the 2nd deadline mentioned above <br/><br/>
* In order to add a new entry, click on `add new record` <br/><br/>

* In order to save time, if you have **multiple areas**, you can list *phone numbers* and *page numbers* corresponding to their respective area like so:

* **Changes to Masters** <br/><br/>
    * If it is still ***before or on the 1st***, you can make changes by:
        * clicking the `edit` button next to the record
        * clicking the `delete` button next to the record <br/><br/>
    * If it is ***after the 1st***, you cannot make changes to Masters
        * You have to get **Dan's signature** and pass along to appropriate people

## Proofing

* **Setting up Adobe Acrobat**:
    * You will want to select the `view` setting of `two-up` so that you can view pages side by side <br/><br/>
    * When you see an error or something that needs to be changed, make a ***comment sticky note*** like in the video below <br/><br/>
    * Save your changes as `..._Jin's`
        * e.g. `1SF May 1st Proof_Jin's` <br/><br/>

* **Using Masters to proof**
    * I like to *highlight my entries* on the physical masters sheets so once it is time to proof, you can quickly see the entries that are important <br/><br/>
    * ***Things to double check***:
        1. *Phone numbers*
        2. *Categories*
        3. *Changes you requested*

* **Your First Proof**:
    * On your first pass through the magazine, just look for companies that might be a ***conflict of interest*** with one another on each side when the magazine is open on a page <br/><br/>
    * Then look to see if the ***changes you specified on Masters I and II*** were made correctly <br/><br/>
    * Finally, make sure the rest of your clients (*the ones in the file folder bin*) are correct
        * What I mean by 'correct' can differ client to client
        * e.g. Some clients I just check their numbers every month and others I just do a click glance over their categores, #'s, and ads to make sure they are good to go <br/><br/>


* **Your Second Proof**:
    * All you are doing on the second Proof is checking to see if the editors *made your change(s) successfully* <br/><br/>
    * If they did not make your change(s), ***email them*** a reminder to make the change(s) <br/><br/>

* **Your Final Proof**:
    * This is the easiest, because they typically get things right on the second proof <br/><br/>
    * If the second proof is good, then you don't have to do anything <br/><br/>
    * Again, if they mess up, email them and make sure the change gets made

## Signing a Contract

* **Crunching the numbers**: <br/><br/>

    ![calc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20076677/25754416/e7d87618-3173-11e7-86c4-8103a96f31e3.gif) <br/><br/>

    * If you have to do it by hand for more complex contracts (like different size ads in multiple areas) do this in the correct order: <br/><br/>
        1. **Multiply ad price** (black & white) by # of areas
            * OR add up all of the prices of the ads
                *e.g. $149 (1/12 ad) + $199 (1/6 add) <br/><br/>
        2. **Add 15%** for spot color or **25%** for full color <br/><br/>
        3. **Add 10%** for priority position if requested (they have to have a full pg.) <br/><br/>
        4.** Add cost of extra categories $15 each** (they get two free ones) <br/><br/>
        5. **Subtract multiple area** discount <br/><br/>
        6. **Subtract 5%** advanced pay discount (if they pay a year in advance) <br/><br/>
        7. **Round the #** down to the nearest dollar <br/><br/>




* ***Here is What We Need On the Contract:*** <br/><br/>
    * **1st month payment** up front either by check, credit, or bank <br/><br/>
    * **Signature** under payment section if they enter credit or bank <br/><br/>
    * **Signature** at the bottom right <br/><br/>
    * Needs to be **signed by high-level manager** or owner if a small company (*does not apply to big companies*) <br/><br/>
    * Double check that your **numbers** are right <br/><br/>
    * **Initial** the contract if all looks good <br/><br/>
    * Give Shelly a **copy** <br/><br/>
    * **Shred** sensitive details on your contract (*I cut them out and shred them*) <br/><br/>

## Cancellations

* ***Pro-rating***
    * If someone signs a contract and then cancels before the contract expires they will be **pro-rated** to however long they were in there for <br/><br/>
        * e.g. If they signed a **12 month contract** and cancelled after **6 months**, we will pro-rate them to the **6 time** rate. <br/><br/>
        * If they cancelled after **11 months**, we would pro-rate them to the **6 time rate** <br/><br/>
        * If they cancelled after **5 months**, we would pro-rate them to the **3 time rate** <br/><br/>
        * If they cancelled after **2 months**, we would pro-rate them to the **1 time rate** <br/><br/>
