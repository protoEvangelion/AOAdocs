## Deadlines

* To keep things simple for yourself here is how to communicate deadlines to clients:
    * **Ad needs changes or needs to be created**: 1st of the preceding month
          * e.g. ***January 1st*** for the February publication <br/><br/>
    * **Ad is ready to go**: 7th of the preceding month
        * e.g. ***January 7th*** for the February publication <br/><br/>

* You have until around **10am** the following day to finish your masters changes

## Late Changes

* If a current client or a prospective client wants to make changes **after the 1st** AND you have not put them on masters, you have to: <br/><br/>
    1. Get Dan's ***signature*** <br/><br/>
    2. Make copies for Jamil and Shelly

## Using Masters

* ***Masters 1*** corresponds to the 1st deadline mentioned above
* ***Masters 2*** corresponds to the 2nd deadline mentioned above
* In order to add a new entry, click on `add new record`

* In order to save time, if you have **multiple areas**, you can list *phone numbers* and *page numbers* corresponding to their respective area like so:

* **Changes to Masters**
    * If it is still ***before or on the 1st***, you can make changes by:
        * clicking the `edit` button next to the record
        * clicking the `delete` button next to the record
    * If it is ***after the 1st***, you cannot make changes to Masters
        * You have to get **Dan's signature** and pass along to appropriate people

## Proofing

* **Setting up Adobe Acrobat**:
    * You will want to select the `view` setting of `two-up` so that you can view pages side by side
    * When you see an error or something that needs to be changed, make a ***comment sticky note*** like in the video below
    * Save your changes as `..._Jin's`
        * e.g. `1SF May 1st Proof_Jin's`

* **Using Masters to proof**
    * I like to *highlight my entries* on the physical masters sheets so once it is time to proof, you can quickly see the entries that are important
    * ***Things to double check***:
        1. *Phone numbers*
        2. *Categories*
        3. *Changes you requested*

* **Your First Proof**:
    * On your first pass through the magazine, just look for companies that might be a ***conflict of interest*** with one another on each side when the magazine is open on a page
    * Then look to see if the ***changes you specified on Masters I and II*** were made correctly
    * Finally, make sure the rest of your clients (*the ones in the file folder bin*) are correct
        * What I mean by 'correct' can differ client to client
        * e.g. Some clients I just check their numbers every month and others I just do a click glance over their categores, #'s, and ads to make sure they are good to go


* **Your Second Proof**:
    * All you are doing on the second Proof is checking to see if the editors *made your change(s) successfully*
    * If they did not make your change(s), ***email them*** a reminder to make the change(s)

* **Your Final Proof**:
    * This is the easiest, because they typically get things right on the second proof
    * If the second proof is good, then you don't have to do anything
    * Again, if they mess up, email them and make sure the change gets made
