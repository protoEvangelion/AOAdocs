# Tradeshow Docs

## Selling a Booth

* Most of your booth sales will come from **previous clients renewing**
    * When you begin marketing for a new show, ***GMâ€™s email templates*** come in quite handy for emailing previous clients show info (floor plan, reservation form)
        * You can modify existing templates to your liking, or create brand new ones
        * This speeds up the emailing process significantly <br/><br/>

* The best leads you will find come from trade shows and call-ins <br/><br/>

*	We do not negotiate down in price but are always willing to negotiate up if they would like ðŸ˜‰ <br/><br/>

*	Ensure that competition is **at least 3 booths away** (ideally more than 3) <br/><br/>

*	You must collect on the booth for it to count towards your bonus AND/OR commission (your situation may be different depending on what you work out with Dan) <br/><br/>

*	**Booth space includes**: Show colored royal blue drapery, carpet, and company ID sign <br/><br/>

* **Does not include**: Tables, chairs, electrical, Wi-Fi, or parking permits
    * They can bring their own tables, decorations and Wi-Fi hotspot OR rent from:
        * **All Rentals**: Blaine Convention Services (Contact: 714-522-8270)
        * **Wi-Fi**: Smart City (Contact: 213-765-4647) <br/><br/>

## After You Sell a Booth

*	Double check to make sure the booth is **at least 3 booths away** from other competitors (if unsure check with other sales people)

    * I.E. If you see a plumber in booth and want to place another plumber **in booth 607**, that would be too close because it is **only two booths away.  605** would be ok though.

    * **Be particularly careful** with handymen, general contractors, and lenders as they could be a potential conflict with many vendors <br/><br/>

*	***Fill out*** the reservation form making sure info is correct <br/><br/>

*	***Transfer*** that info to GM by updating current contact (cross check for accuracy) or by creating a new one <br/><br/>

*	***Email*** client the confirmation template using GM. <br/><br/>

*	***Update*** the floor plan to reflect the status of the booth (holding, need to collect, good to go) <br/><br/>

*	Make a ***copy*** for Shelly and yourself. <br/><br/>

*	***Email every Friday*** Blaine the new companies that need to be sent the exhibitor kit
    * Emails:
        * TO: agutensohn@blainesvs.com
        * CC: jruppert@blainesvs.com; jkraye@blainesvs.com; ngamache@blainesvs.com <br/><br/>


## Sponsorships

*	They can choose a 3, 4 or 5 star sponsorship <br/><br/>

*	They can **exchange** components of the package for other components for equal or lesser value

    *	IE: FastEvict.com Law group chose to drop:

        *	**$750**: Website tower ad
        *	**$150**: Contractors & Vendors portal listing
        *	**$100**: Listing upgrade in program <br/><br/>

    *	They then extended their magazine ad from a Â½ pg. 1 month ad to a **1/6 pg. 7 month ad.** *(1/2 pg. full color ad is worth $1050; 1/6 pg. full color ad is worth $1841)* <br/><br/>

*	You can **exchange components** as you please but it may overly complicate things for yourself. <br/><br/>

## Buyer's Guide

*	The buyerâ€™s guides are passed out to trade show attendees which include vendor info <br/><br/>

*	Vendor info is derived from the trade show **reservation forms** so it is important that the info is correct

    *	If the vendor is a previous client, **cross check GM** to resolve any discrepancies with:
        *	*Company Name*
        *	*Phone numbers*
        *	*Emails*
        *	*Websites*
        *	*Categories* <br/><br/>

*	All reservation forms must be copied and sent to Juan before the specified deadline <br/><br/>


## Email Reminders

*	It is ***very important*** to remind clients about their booth location and show info at least one time via email (*ideally two times*)

    *	Send **1st reminder** emails to clients 1-2 weeks before the show
    *	Send **2nd reminder** emails 1 day before the show
    *	You can use ***GMâ€™s email template*** feature along with the booth input field in GM to speed this up <br/><br/>
